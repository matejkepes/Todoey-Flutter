# About - Todoey-Flutter 🌟
A todolist app to keep track of all your tasks and to learn about State Management and Provider Pattern

## Objective 🎯
The objective of this project is to understand how to manage state in Flutter. We looked at various Flutter architecture choices, concept of Prop Drilling and also learnt to use the officially recommended Provider package to manage our app state. If you want to test the app in your device then you can find the latest [release](https://github.com/rajitdeb/Todoey-Flutter/releases/tag/release) in the release section of the repository.
